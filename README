== TODO LIST ==
* Add keyboard shortcuts
 => Choice: Include in main extension (will require permission to all data on all sites) or 
            Make a separate extension which interacts with sharkzapper (which the user will have to install separately)
* Add Popup "Docking" or "Pinning"
 => Choice: Use Window popups for draggable window (and not have Always on Top)
              or
            Use HTML Notifications for static window (with Always on Top but no ability to search for a song)
* Fix the damn "I can't read the search box" bug
 => Problem: I *can* read the search box

* Make an options page to let the user choose what they want
